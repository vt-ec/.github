## 🗺️ About Me

| ✅ | Detail |
|---|--------|
| **💼** | Senior Firmware Engineer – **Vigilantech Inc.** (since 2015) |
| **📍** | Newark, New Jersey, USA (remote‑first, occasional on‑site hack‑fests) |
| **🔧** | Embedded C, Rust (embedded), Python (test‑automation), Yocto/OpenEmbedded, FreeRTOS, Zephyr |
| **⚡** | Low‑power computer‑vision pipelines, on‑device AI NPU integration, secure‑boot alternatives, and the **Whispered Cipher**. |
| **🧩** | Loves turning hardware limitations into creative features – e.g., “what‑if we could run a face‑recognition model on a 32 KB MCU?” |
| **🎭** | Contributor to open‑source IoT security projects, speaker at **DEF CON IoT Village**, organizer of **Open‑Design Fridays** at Vigilantech. |
| **🤖** | When I’m not chasing bugs, I’m teaching kids how to build tiny robots with recycled parts. |

**My mantra:** *“We see everything, we guard nothing – but we always leave a breadcrumb for the curious.”*
